<p>Antarctica is the Earth's southernmost continent, located almost entirely within the Antarctic Circle. It is the fifth-largest continent in the world, covering an area of about 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles). Despite its size, Antarctica is mostly a frozen desert, with an average annual temperature of -58&deg;F (-50&deg;C). The continent is surrounded by the Southern Ocean and is divided into two parts by the Transantarctic Mountains.</p>
<p>Despite the harsh conditions of the continent, Antarctica is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including some of the most iconic and well-known animals on the planet. The continent is home to several species of penguins, including the Emperor Penguin, the largest species of penguin in the world. These penguins can be found in large colonies along the coast, where they breed and raise their young. In addition to penguins, Antarctica is home to several species of seals, including the Leopard Seal and the Southern Elephant Seal. These seals are well-adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of the continent, with thick layers of blubber to keep them warm. Seals can be found basking on the ice or swimming in the surrounding ocean. Antarctica is also home to a number of species of whales, including the Humpback Whale and the Blue Whale, the largest animal on the planet. These whales can be found feeding on the rich supply of krill that is found in the waters around the continent.</p>
